// omashell:lock-view v5
//
// Written into the clone of Omarchy's lock plugin by
// scripts/lock-screen. Omarchy's own view is kept beside it as
// StockLockView.qml and its Service.qml is untouched, so every part of the
// lock that matters -- PAM, the stranded-lock recovery, the blanking timers
// and the `lock` IPC that `omarchy system lock` and `omarchy-system-sleep-lock`
// call -- is still Omarchy's.
//
// This file only chooses who draws. It deliberately imports nothing from
// Omashell: Omashell's UI is loaded by URL, so a missing, broken or removed
// Omashell still leaves a working lock screen (the stock one) behind.
