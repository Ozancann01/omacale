-- Ported from caelestia-dots (hypr/variables.lua, hypr/hyprland/animations.lua,
-- decoration.lua, general.lua, rules.lua). Border colours stay with the
-- Omarchy theme (its hyprland.lua); the window shadow is Omashell's own frame
-- shadow, measured (see below).

-- Windows cast the same shadow as Omashell's frame and drawers, which sit
-- right beside them. That shadow is ScreenScope's MultiEffect: black
-- (Colours.m3shadow) at 0.7, blurMax 15. It was rendered and read back pixel
-- by pixel: 0.247 alpha at the edge, 0.129 at 2px, 0.055 at 4px, 0.016 at
-- 8px, gone by 14px. Hyprland's shadow is alpha * (1 - (d + 0.5) / range) ^
-- render_power (measured the same way, for every range/power pair), and the
-- least-squares fit of that to the frame's profile is range 15, power 4 and
-- black at 0.275 alpha: RMSE 0.004 alpha, within 4% of the frame's total
-- darkness.
--
-- Hyprland multiplies a window's shadow by the window's own opacity (measured:
-- 0.9 and 0.855 opaque windows cast 0.9x and 0.855x the shadow), so the colour
-- is divided by windowOpacity to land on 0.275 for the default-opacity windows.
--
-- The accent tint at 0x10 this used before (Caelestia's inversePrimary)
-- peaked at 6% alpha, so windows looked flat next to the shadowed frame.

-- ── Omashell's scale ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
-- The gaps and the window rounding follow Omashell's UI scale, so windows keep
-- their place in the frame at any size. The values above are the 1x ones.
--
-- Rounding is concentric with the frame: a window sits gaps_out inside the
-- frame's inner corner, so its corner is that radius minus the gap (outer =
-- inner + gap). 25px frame - 10px gap = 15px at 1x. A lone window's wider
-- gap would want a smaller radius still, but Hyprland's rounding is global.
--
-- The shell (services/HyprLook.qml) writes its spacing scale and frame
-- rounding to $XDG_STATE_HOME/omashell/hypr.lua, read here on every load, and
-- calls omashell_apply() with the same table when they change, so a change
-- lands at once and survives `hyprctl reload`. Without the file (no Omashell
-- shell yet) everything stays at 1x.

-- ── Animations (animations.lua) ─────────────────────────────────────────────
-- Hyprland's windows are given the motion of Omashell's own drawers, so a
-- window and a blob drawer arriving at the same moment read as one gesture.
--
-- The two engines turn out to agree exactly, which is what makes this a port
-- and not an approximation:
--
--   * Hyprland's `speed` is deciseconds -- hyprutils' CBaseAnimatedVariable
--     computes SPENT = clamp((elapsed_ms / 100) / speed, 0, 1), so a leaf's
--     duration in ms is speed * 100. Every speed below is a Tk.durations
--     value divided by 100.
--   * `hl.curve{ points = { {x1,y1}, {x2,y2} } }` is a cubic bezier through
--     (0,0) and (1,1), evaluated as getYForPoint(SPENT) with NO clamping of
--     y. That is the same math as Qt's Easing.BezierSpline over a 6-value
--     [x1,y1,x2,y2,1,1] array, so the Tk.curves entries transfer verbatim --
--     overshoot (y > 1) included, which is what gives the spatial curves
--     their settle.
--
-- The one curve that cannot cross is `emphasized`: Omashell's is a TWO segment
-- spline (12 values), and Hyprland's addBezierWithName only takes two control
-- points. It is fitted below.
--
-- ── Matching the motion, not just the numbers ───────────────────────────────
--
-- A curve and a duration alone do NOT make two animations match, because the
-- things being moved are not the same size. Omashell's drawers are small: the
-- sidebar and utilities are 430px wide and slide in by their own width plus
-- 5px, so 435px over 500ms. A maximised window here is 1824px wide and a
-- workspace switch crosses the whole 1920px monitor. Handing those the same
-- 500ms makes them travel 4-7x faster than the drawers, which is what broke
-- the illusion even though every curve and duration was already "correct".
--
-- So each leaf is matched on PEAK EDGE VELOCITY against the drawer, which is
-- 435px * 3.29 (spatial's peak rate) / 0.5s = 2859 px/s. Two levers do it:
--
--   1. Shorten the travel. `popin P%` starts a window at P% of its size, so
--      each edge only moves (1-P)/2 of that size -- popin 50% turns an 1824px
--      window into a 456px edge move, the drawer's 435px almost exactly.
--      Window `slide` has NO percentage (applyWindowStyle only parses a
--      direction), so it always travels the full window width and cannot be
--      velocity-matched at any duration -- 870 px/s would need 2100ms.
--      `slidefade P%` / `slidefadevert P%` are the same lever for workspaces,
--      moving monitor_size * P/100 while cross-fading.
--   2. Stretch the duration, but only as far as Omashell itself does. Its own
--      tokens imply a strongly sub-linear law: fastSpatial moves ~40px in
--      350ms and spatial moves 435px in 500ms, so duration = 500 * (d/435)^0.15.
--      Ten times the distance buys barely half again the time. Every duration
--      below agrees with that law to within a few ms.
--
-- Resulting peak velocities, as a multiple of the drawer's:
--   windowsIn popin 50%    1.05x      layersIn slide        0.99x
--   workspaces slidefade   1.10x      specialWorkspace      0.93x
--   windowsMove            1.75x  <-- the one that cannot be fixed; its travel
--                                     is set by the tiling layout, not by us.
-- The *Out leaves land near 1.6x, but on emphasizedAccel the peak falls at the
-- very END of the curve, by which point the window has already shrunk and
-- faded to nothing, so it is not seen.

-- Tk.durations, in Hyprland's deciseconds (Tk.animScale = 1).

-- Windows grow like Settings and the overview. Omashell's floating drawers
-- (r4, r7) open by scaling out of a small centred pill -- ScreenScope's
-- `nw = nfw * (1 - 0.55 * nOff)`, so 45% of full width up to 100%. "popin 50%"
-- is that same construction: applyPopin seeds size.from at GOALSIZE * 0.5 and
-- pos.from at the centre, then animates both to the goal.
--
-- 50% is not a taste pick, it is the number that makes a window's edges move
-- at the drawers' speed: (1 - 0.50)/2 * 1824px = 456px, against the drawers'
-- 435px, both over 500ms. "slide" was the faithful *shape* of the drawer
-- motion but it travels the window's whole width, which is 4.2x the drawers'
-- velocity and has no percentage to dial it back.
-- Jelly: windows open, close and move on the drawers' own spring rather than a
-- bezier. Hyprland 0.56 has real spring curves, and BlobDeform.qml's is mass
-- 1, stiffness 200, damping 16 -- underdamped (zeta 0.57), so it overshoots by
-- ~12% of the travel and wobbles back once, settling in ~0.5s. A spring runs
-- until it settles, so `speed` doesn't time these leaves. popin 87% keeps the
