import QtQuick
import Quickshell

// The unlock animation's hand-off from the lock surface to the bar.
//
// Caelestia owns its session lock, so it plays the card's closing first and
// only then sets `locked: false`. Omashell's lock is Omarchy's (see
// LockService): its `finishUnlock()` drops the session lock in the same call
// that tells our view the password was accepted, and the lock surface goes
// with it, so nothing drawn on that surface is ever seen leaving.
//
// So the card the user sees is drawn by an overlay of Omashell's own
// (LockUnlockFx, one per screen), which Hyprland draws *above* the lock
// (the `above_lock = 2` layer rule, set in Bar.qml and omashell.lua). It is up
// for the whole lock, mirroring the lock's own card frame for frame, while
// the lock surface below it keeps the keyboard, the backdrop and PAM. When
// the lock goes, the card is already on screen, so the closing simply plays
// on, with no hand-off frame. Nothing in Omarchy's lock service changes.
//
// LockUi shares this singleton (it imports Omashell's module) and reports, per
// screen name:
//   arm(name, ui)        the real lock is up on that screen, drawn by `ui`
//   ready(name, frame)   its opening has finished: `frame` is a grab of the
//                        lock's blurred backdrop, for the overlay to fade out
//   unlock(name)         the lock let go: play the closing
//   disarm(name)         the lock surface went without an unlock
// and the overlay reports cover(name, on): whether Hyprland is really
// drawing it above the lock. Only then does the lock hide its own card, so a
// Hyprland without the rule still shows the lock's card, just no closing.
