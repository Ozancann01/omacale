# Never wakes a runtime-suspended NVIDIA dGPU (common on hybrid laptops):
# polling nvidia-smi would power it up and cost battery.
#
# $1, when given, is the adapter name the caller already has. The name never
# changes, but looking it up costs an `lspci` (~10ms) and, on NVIDIA, a second
# `nvidia-smi` (~24ms) -- most of this script's cost, paid once a second by a
# poll that only wants the two numbers. Sys.qml passes the name back in as
# soon as it knows it, so only the first call of a session resolves it.
#
# $2 is the type that name was resolved for, and the name is only reused for
# that adapter. A session that starts with the dGPU parked resolves the iGPU's
# name; stamping it onto a later NVIDIA reading labels the dGPU with the
# iGPU's name. A mismatch costs one lookup, on the transition only.
