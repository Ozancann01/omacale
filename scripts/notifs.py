"""Omarchy's notification records as JSON, newest first.

Omarchy's notification daemon keeps one file per notification: while a toast
is on screen its file sits in ~/.local/state/omarchy/notifications/, and when
the toast goes it moves down into history/. There is no IPC that hands the
whole set over, so we read the files.

  (no argument)   live popups + history, deduped -- the sidebar's centre.
  live            only the popups currently on screen.
  watch           `live`, printed once now and again on every change, one
                  JSON object per line. A toast has to appear the moment its
                  file does, and one long-lived process polling a four-entry
                  directory is far cheaper than respawning this script.
